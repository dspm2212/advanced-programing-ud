## Project Introduction:

Virtual Xperience is a virtual event platform that facilitates the organization, management, and participation in these events. Users can register to access events of interest and can also create events with their own activities and assignments.

The application features a calendar for users to view their schedule and the scheduled events and activities.

## Business Model:

The business model of virtual event platforms is based on creating new events, where the organizer can add activities and assignments online. Users can also design these events.

Some features of the platforms include:

- **Create Events:** The organizer can design virtual events and activities, with date, time, description, and type.
  
- **Registration Management:** The platform facilitates the registration process for participants, some product sales, and email confirmations.

- **Real-Time Interaction:** The platform provides tools to interact with other participants in real-time, such as chats, forums, and question and answer sessions.

- **Access to Content:** Participants can access event materials, such as slides, videos, chats, and related topics.

- **Monetization:** Ways the platform acquires money include: ads, premium memberships, exclusive material, etc.

To design the business model, we need to create an architecture that can manage many events simultaneously. Another important aspect is the security of this project.
